<p>Application development is tough. Especially design of simple and usable applications.</p>
<p>In order to be alive and sustainable the application shall bring some profit - there is no free beer unfortunately under the Sun yet. If someone offers you something for free then it means you are giving them your  <del>soul</del> data that will be used in myriad of ways for the benefit of that &quot;free beer company&quot;.</p>
<p>I've created this HTML-NOTEPAD application for myself as I am writing quite a lot on Internet these days. And I am giving it for free with the hope it will be useful for others.</p>
<p>While HTML-NOTEPAD suits my needs, for you it may lack some features or be buggy on some functions. That means some additional development is and will be required.</p>
<p>So please <a href="https://html-notepad.com/to-make-it-better/#help-to-develop">help to make this application better</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, each penny really counts.</p>
